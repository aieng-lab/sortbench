The code snippet provided is a Python script that takes in an array of integers and prints out the minimum value.

Here's how you can modify it to calculate the maximum value:

```python
# This will print the maximum value in the array
print(max(array))
```

However, if you want to create your own function without using the built-in max() or min() functions, here is a simple implementation:

```python
def find_max(arr):
    max_value = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = num
    return max_value

# Replace array with your actual array
array = [/* Your array */]

print(find_max(array))
```

In the function `find_max`, we start by assuming that the first element is the maximum. We then iterate through each number in the array, updating our `max_value` if we find a number greater than it.

Note: The above solution assumes that the input array is not empty. If there's a possibility of an empty array being passed to the function, you should add some error checking code to handle this situation.
