The code you provided does not generate a random number as its output is always the same, and it also includes an array of numbers in a comment that seems unrelated to the function's purpose.

However, if we ignore the commented-out array and assume that the intention was indeed to return a random number between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), here's how you could do it:

```python
import random

def get_random_number():
    """
    Returns a random integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
    """
    return random.randint(1, 1000)

# Example usage:
print(get_random_number())
```

In this code:

*   We import the `random` module to access its functions for generating random numbers.
*   The `get_random_number` function uses `random.randint(a, b)` to generate a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`.
*   Finally, we provide an example usage of the function by printing out the generated random number.
