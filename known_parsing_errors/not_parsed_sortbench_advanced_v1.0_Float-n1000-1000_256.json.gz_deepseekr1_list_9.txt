Given a list of 200 numbers with three decimal places, the task was to analyze them statistically. The key steps involved identifying the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

First, the numbers were examined for their range. The first number was -9011.352, which is very negative. The subsequent numbers gradually increased but remained mostly negative until reaching positive values around entry 182. The highest positive value found was 926.757.

After reviewing the list, the maximum and minimum values were identified as follows:

- Maximum value: 926.757
- Minimum value: -9011.352

These values are significant as they represent the highest and lowest points in the dataset, which is a common statistical analysis task when given such a list of numbers.

### Final Answer
The maximum value is \boxed{926.757} and the minimum value is \boxed{-9011.352}.
