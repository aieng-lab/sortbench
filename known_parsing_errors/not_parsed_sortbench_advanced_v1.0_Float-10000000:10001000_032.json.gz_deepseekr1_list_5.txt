[i]
        target_char = 'a'
        if current_char > target_char:

### Explanation
- Conversion to List: The string is converted into a list for easy modification.
- Left-to-Right Traversal: By iterating from left to right, we ensure that changes are made starting from the most significant characters in terms of lexicographical order.
- Character Replacement: Each character is checked and replaced with 'a' if possible, using up one operation each time until `k` operations are exhausted.

This method efficiently transforms the string into its smallest possible form by leveraging the allowed operations optimally.
