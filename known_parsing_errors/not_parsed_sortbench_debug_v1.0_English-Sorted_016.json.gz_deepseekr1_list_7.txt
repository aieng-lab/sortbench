The system uses lexicographical ordering to sort words. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Compare each character from left to right.
2. The string with the smaller character at the first differing position comes first.
3. If one string is a prefix of the other, the shorter string comes first.

Applying this:

- strip-search vs. struthionidae: At the fourth character, 'i' < 'u', so "strip-search" comes before "struthionidae".
- After these, words starting with 'suck', 'sug', and then 'sweet' follow since 'su...' precedes 'sw...'.

Final Answer:

\boxed{strip-search, struthionidae, suckle, sugi, sweet-balm}
