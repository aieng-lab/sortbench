To determine the order of strings that all begin with "ccc", we compare the substrings following "ccc" lexicographically. This involves examining each character in sequence until a difference is found, taking into account their ASCII values which affect their order.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Identify Common Prefix: All strings start with "ccc".
2. Compare Remaining Substrings: Focus on the parts after "ccc" to determine the order.
3. Lexicographical Order: Compare character by character based on ASCII values, where special characters and uppercase letters come before lowercase letters.

Example:

- cccApple
- cccBanana
- cccCherry

The sorted order is:
1. cccApple
2. cccBanana
3. cccCherry

Answer: The strings are ordered based on their suffixes after "ccc" in lexicographical sequence.

\boxed{cccApple, cccBanana, cccCherry}
