[{key: data[key]} for key in sorted_keys]

# Print the result
for item in result:
    print(item)
```

### Explanation
1. Extract Keys: We start by extracting all the keys from the provided dictionary.
2. Sort Keys: Using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, we sort these keys lexicographically.
3. Create Pairs: For each key in the sorted list, we create a dictionary where both the key and value are the same, resulting in a list of single-key-value dictionaries.

This approach ensures that the final output is a list of key-value pairs sorted alphabetically by their keys, which meets the problem's requirements efficiently.
