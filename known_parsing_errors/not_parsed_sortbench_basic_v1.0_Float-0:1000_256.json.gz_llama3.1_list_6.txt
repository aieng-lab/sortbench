The code you provided is designed to identify a specific pattern in the data. It appears to be checking if each number in the list is within a certain range of its rounded value. If it is not, then it prints "Error: {} is too far from {}".format(number, round_number).

To optimize this code, we can use list comprehension and the `all()` function to simplify the checks:

```python
def check_numbers(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    return all(abs(num - round_num) < 0.1 for num, round_num in zip(numbers, rounded_numbers))

numbers = [/* your list of numbers */]
if not check_numbers(numbers):
    print("Error: Numbers are too far from their rounded values")
```

This code works by creating a new list of the rounded numbers using a list comprehension, and then using the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if all numbers in the original list are within 0.1 of their corresponding rounded value.

Note that this code does not print specific error messages for each number that is too far from its rounded value, but instead prints a single message indicating that there was an error. If you need more detailed error reporting, you may want to stick with your original approach or modify this one to include additional logic for printing error messages.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def check_numbers(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    errors = [(num, round_num) for num, round_num in zip(numbers, rounded_numbers) if abs(num - round_num) >= 0.1]
    if errors:
        print("Error: The following numbers are too far from their rounded values:")
        for num, round_num in errors:
            print("{} is too far from {}".format(num, round_num))
```

This version of the code creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and its corresponding rounded value if the absolute difference between them is 0.1 or greater. It then prints an error message for each pair in this list.
