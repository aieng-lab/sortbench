### Explanation
1. Extract Substrings: Each string in the list starts with "YYY". By slicing each string from the 4th character onwards (`x[3:]`), we get the substring that needs to be considered for sorting.
2. Sorting Mechanism: The `sorted()` function is used with a custom key that extracts the relevant substring. This ensures that the strings are compared and ordered based on their meaningful parts after "YYY".

This approach efficiently sorts the list by focusing on the relevant part of each string, ensuring accurate lexicographical ordering as required.
