It seems like you've shared a list of numbers under the label "System." However, your request is unclear. Could you clarify what you need help with regarding this data? Are you looking for statistical analysis (e.g., mean, median), sorting, or something else?

Depending on your requirements, I can assist with:

1. Statistical Analysis: Calculating measures like average, median, standard deviation, etc.
2. Sorting: Arranging the numbers in ascending or descending order.
3. Pattern Identification: Looking for trends or specific sequences within the data.
4. Data Transformation: Converting the numbers into different formats or units.

Please provide more details about what you need, and I'll be happy to help!
