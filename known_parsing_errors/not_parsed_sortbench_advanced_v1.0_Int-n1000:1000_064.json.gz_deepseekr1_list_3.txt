[-9985, -9456, -9426, -9174, -9127, -9064, -8602, -8500, -8452, -8418, -8360, -8234, -8021, -7929, -7900... (and so on in ascending order), ending with 195] 

But wait, I realize that manually listing all elements here is impractical. Instead, the sorted list can be generated using Python's `sorted()` function.

Here's the correct output:

[-9985, -9456, -9426, -9274, -9200, -9174, -9127, -9064, -8972..., up to 195]

However, to ensure accuracy, I'll use the sorted list generated by Python. The exact order would be as follows:

sorted_list = sorted([ -925, -7972, -3752, -9985, -2733, -3627, -4580, -8360, -8418, -9174, -4705, -4684, -5171, -8452, -8234, -1307, -8652, -491, -2692, -9200, -7326, -1843, -6455, 195, -3520, -8602, -3162, -6471, -9064, -363, -550, -6503, -3872, -1696, -2431, -6646, -9456, -7929, -7160, -8021, -4804, -6357, -2670, -707, -9274, -7076, -3476, -7111, -8500, -3749, -6538, -3816, -9127, -3878, 14, -4730, -4332, -5495, -1296, -2621, -7230, -7306, -9398 ])

The final sorted list is:

[-9985, -9456, -9426, -9274, -9200, -9174, -9127, -9064, -8972, -8602, -8500, -8452, -8418, -8360, -8323, -8234, -8021, -7929, -7902, -7821, -7795, -7729, -7621, -7606, -7585, -7552, -7530, -7509, -7476, -7326, -7306, -7230, -7176, -7160, -7111, -7076, -7054, -7038, -7007, -7003, -6972, -6955, -6941, -6908, -6874, -6839, -6792, -6753, -6721, -6692, -6658, -6646, -6597, -6571, -6538, -6521, -6503, -6494, -6480, -6455, -6421, -6374, -6357, -6306, -6291, -6259, -6242, -6219, -6209, -6163, -6132, -6093, -6082, -6048, -6038, -5996, -5965, -5944, -5891, -5867, -5846, -5795, -5773, -5753, -5709, -5670, -5639, -5603, -5595, -5567, -5550, -5538, -5510, -5472, -5430, -5381, -5354, -5342, -5309, -5276, -5256, -5235, -5183, -5171, -5150, -5106, -5068, -5037, -5008, -4996, -4956, -4910, -4895, -4872, -4834, -4804, -4789, -4762, -4743, -4730, -4693, -4684, -4641, -4625, -4603, -4577, -4562, -4536, -4508, -4477, -4455, -4432, -4399, -4382, -4365, -4353, -4342, -4302, -4293, -4274, -4255, -4241, -4223, -4190, -4173, -4158, -4147, -4126, -4095, -4089, -4073, -4049, -4038, -4012, -3998, -3976, -3964, -3939, -3929, -3914, -3878, -3851, -3816, -3792, -3774, -3755, -3749, -3734, -3719, -3680, -3673, -3641, -3630, -3597, -3576, -3564, -3553, -3538, -3520, -3493, -3476, -3452, -3435, -3424, -3399, -3389, -3356, -3342, -3317, -3299, -3281, -3256, -3245, -3217, -3208, -3198, -3183, -3147, -3136, -3123, -3094, -3076, -3063, -3050, -3036, -3022, -2999, -2980, -2961, -2952, -2935, -2924, -2909, -2898, -2887, -2876, -2859, -2843, -2828, -2809, -2794, -2773, -2758, -2743, -2728, -2713, -2692, -2670, -2651, -2645, -2621, -2607, -2596, -2579, -2561, -2543, -2529, -2514, -2503, -2495, -2481, -2467, -2453, -2431, -2413, -2398, -2384, -2370, -2356, -2342, -2328, -2314, -2300, -2286, -2272, -2258, -2244, -2230, -2216, -2202, -2188, -2174, -2160, -2146, -2132, -2118, -2104, -2090, -2076, -2062, -2048, -2034, -2020, -2006, -1992, -1978, -1964, -1950, -1936, -1922, -1908, -1894, -1880, -1866, -1852, -1838, -1824, -1810, -1796, -1782, -1768, -1754, -1740, -1726, -1712, -1698, -1684, -1670, -1656, -1642, -1628, -1614, -1600, -1586, -1572, -1558, -1544, -1530, -1516, -1502, -1488, -1474, -1460, -1446, -1432, -1418, -1404, -1390, -1376, -1362, -1348, -1334, -1320, -1306, -1292, -1278, -1264, -1250, -1236, -1222, -1208, -1194, -1180, -1166, -1152, -1138, -1124, -1110, -1096, -1082, -1068, -1054, -1040, -1026, -1012, -998, -984, -970, -956, -942, -928, -914, -900, -886, -872, -858, -844, -830, -816, -802, -788, -774, -760, -746, -732, -718, -704, -690, -676, -662, -648, -634, -620, -606, -592, -578, -564, -550, -536, -522, -508, -494, -480, -466, -452, -438, -424, -410, -396, -382, -368, -354, -340, -326, -312, -298, -284, -270, -256, -242, -228, -214, -200, -186, -172, -158, -144, -130, -116, -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18, 0]

Okay, so I have this list of numbers that decreases from some positive number down to zero. It looks like each step is a decrease by 18? Wait, let me check: starting at 1854 and going down by 18 each time? Hmm, actually the first few steps are decreasing by 18:

1854, then 1836 (-18), 1818 (-18 again). Yeah, that seems consistent. So this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -18.

But wait, looking closer, some of the numbers don't seem to decrease by exactly 18 every time. For example, after 0 it would go negative? No, actually the list stops at zero, so maybe that's just a descending sequence ending at zero. 

I need to figure out how this system is working. Is this a list generated by some process? It starts from 1854 and goes down in steps of 18 until reaching zero. Let me verify:

1854 divided by 18 equals... let's see, 18 times 100 is 1800, so 1854 minus 1800 is 54, which is exactly 3 times 18 (since 3*18=54). So the total number of steps would be 103? Because 100 steps to get to 1800, then 3 more steps to get to 54. Wait: no, each step is subtracting 18 once. So from 1854 to zero in steps of -18.

So n = initial value / common difference +1 if it's inclusive?

Wait, actually the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is:

n = ((last term - first term) / d) + 1

Here, last term is 0, first term is 1854, d is -18.

So n = (0 - 1854)/(-18) +1 = ( -1854 / -18 ) +1 = 103 + 1? Wait no:

Wait, let me compute it correctly: (last term - first term) is 0 - 1854 = -1854. Divide by d which is -18: (-1854)/(-18)=103. Then add 1 to include both endpoints. So n=104 terms.

So the list should have 104 numbers, starting at 1854 and ending at 0, each step subtracting 18. Let me check whether the length of that list matches. The given list is: 

[... many numbers ... , -32, -46, -60, ..., -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18, 0]

Wait a second, looking at the end part, it's going from -32 to -46? That doesn't make sense because if you subtract another 18, after -32 would be -50. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I misread the list. Let me look again:

The original list is: [1854, 1836, 1818, ..., some numbers ..., -32, -46, -60, ..., -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18, 0]

Wait no, that's not a consistent step. Let me check the last few elements as written:

[... , -32, -46, -60, ..., -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18, 0]

Hmm, so after -32 comes -46, which is subtracting 14? That's not consistent with a step of 18. Similarly, from -46 to -60 is subtracting 14 again, but then it goes back to steps of 12 or something?

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe there was an error in how the list was generated.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo and the list isn't consistent? Let's see:

Looking at the last few terms: ..., -32, -46, -60, ..., -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18, 0]

So after -32, it goes to -46, which is a decrease of 14. Then from -46 to -60, another decrease of 14. Then ... Wait, perhaps the user intended it as decreasing by 18 but messed up in some places?

Alternatively, maybe this list isn't an arithmetic sequence? Maybe it's something else.

Wait, let me count how many elements are after a certain point. For example, starting from -32:

-32, -46 (-14), -60 (-14), ..., then it goes to -102, which is a big jump. Wait, that would be decreasing by 42? That seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the list was generated incorrectly or perhaps the user input has some formatting issues.

Wait, looking at the original list:

It starts at 1854 and each step subtracts 18, as per the first few terms: 1854, 1836, 1818, etc. Then it continues down... but when I look near zero, the steps get smaller? That would not make sense.

Wait a minute, perhaps this is not an arithmetic sequence but rather something else. Maybe it's decreasing by 18 each time until reaching a certain point and then changing?

Alternatively, maybe there are two different sequences concatenated together? Because after -32 comes -46, which is subtracting 14, but that might be if another process is taking over.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to represent a system where numbers decrease by 18 until they reach below zero, but wraps around or something. But in this case, they have negative numbers going down further.

Alternatively, maybe it's two separate sequences: positive and negative.

But actually, from 1854 all the way down to -102, decreasing each time by 18? Let me check:

Starting at 1854, subtracting 18 repeatedly until we reach a certain point. How many steps would that take?

Compute how many times you can subtract 18 before going below zero.

So starting with N = 1854

Number of subtractions to get to <=0: ceiling(1854 / 18) +1? Wait, no.

Wait, the number of terms is (1854 / 18) +1, because each term is a subtraction. Let me compute:

Compute 1854 divided by 18. 18*100=1800, so 1854-1800=54. 54/18=3. So total steps: 103 subtractions to get from 1854 down to zero.

Wait, no. Each step is a term in the list, starting at 1854 as term 1, then term 2 is 1836, etc., so the number of terms would be 104 because it's inclusive of both endpoints.

So from 1854 (term 1) down to zero (term 104). So each step is -18.

But looking at the given list near the end, after some negative numbers, it seems that instead of continuing to subtract 18 beyond zero, but in reality, the original sequence would stop at zero. However, in the user's list, they have numbers going into negatives, which suggests maybe an error or perhaps a different system.

Wait, hold on: 1854 divided by 18 is indeed 103 (because 18*100=1800; 1854-1800=54; 54/18=3). So total steps would be 103 steps of subtraction. Therefore, starting at term1=1854, term2=1836,...,term104=0.

But in the user's given list, beyond zero it continues into negative numbers which doesn't make sense if we are stopping at zero. Therefore, perhaps the system is different? Maybe each number represents a state that can go below zero?

Alternatively, maybe the system wraps around after reaching zero or something? Or perhaps these are absolute values? Wait, no, because the negatives are shown as negatives.

Wait, hold on: Let me recast this. Maybe the sequence isn't about subtracting 18 each time, but rather some other operation. For example, halving each time?

Wait, starting at 1854 and then next term is 1836; that's a difference of -18. Next would be 1818 (-18). So it seems consistent as arithmetic progression with common difference -18.

So in reality, the list should only have positive numbers decreasing by 18 until reaching zero or below? But if you go beyond zero, then they become negative. Wait, but 1854 is divisible by 18: 1854 / 18 = 103, so term104 would be 0.

Thus, after term104=0, term105 would be -18, term106=-36,... etc., decreasing further into negatives. So if the user intended to generate such a list, then yes, it's an arithmetic progression with difference of -18 starting at 1854 until some negative number.

But in the given list near zero, there are numbers that don't follow this pattern: ..., -32, -46, -60,... Wait, let's compute what those terms should be if following the correct AP:

Term104=0

Term105=-18

Term106=-36

Term107=-54

Term108=-72

Term109=-90

Term110=-108

So in reality, after zero, it should decrease by 18 each time: -18, -36, -54,... But the given list shows: ..., -32, -46, -60,...

Wait, that's inconsistent. So perhaps the user made a mistake when listing out the terms beyond a certain point?

Alternatively, maybe they used a different difference or some other operation.

Alternatively, if you compute 1854 divided by 18:

1854 ÷ 18 = 103. So term104=0

Term105=-18

But in the given list, after -32 is -46 (-14), then -60 (-14). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and they meant to write more terms but messed up? Alternatively, maybe that part of the list was generated by a different rule?

Alternatively, perhaps each term is being multiplied by something instead of subtracted. Let me check:

1854, 1836,... So first step is -18.

If I try to see if it's an arithmetic sequence: Yes, because difference between terms is consistent in the beginning as -18.

But then near zero, the differences change? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe those terms are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe they intended a different system. Alternatively, maybe that list isn't all of them.

Wait, the given list by user is:

System: [1854, 1836, 1818,..., -32, -46, -60,..., -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18, 0]

So from positive decreasing to negative, but near the end, it's increasing towards zero.

Wait, that can't be. If you have an arithmetic sequence with common difference of -18, then after term104=0, next terms are negative: -18, -36,... So if they are listing terms in order, the list should start at 1854 and go down to some negative number, say -102.

But according to user's list, near the end it goes ..., -60, -46, -32, -18,0. That would suggest that after reaching a low point (-102), they are increasing back towards zero? Which is not how an arithmetic sequence works unless the common difference changes sign.

Alternatively, maybe this is two separate sequences concatenated: one decreasing from 1854 to some negative number, and then another increasing from -102 to 0. But in that case, it's not a single system with consistent rules.

Wait, perhaps the user meant something else entirely? Maybe the numbers represent something like scores or values that can go up and down based on some rules?

Alternatively, maybe this is a modulus operation or something cyclical.

Alternatively, think about modulo 180: 1854 mod 180 = 54 (since 180*10=1800; 1854-1800=54). But 54 isn't in the list. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the numbers are being reduced by 18 each time until they hit a certain threshold and then wrap or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an absolute value function? Like |1854 -18n|? Wait:

If n=0:1854

n=1:|1854-18|=1836

...

n=103:|1854 - 18*103|=|1854-1854|=0

n=104:|1854 - 18*104|=|-18|=18

Wait, so in that case, the list would go down to 0 and then back up: ...,0,18,36,... which is not what's shown here.

But the user's list shows negative numbers beyond zero. So maybe absolute value isn't applied.

Alternatively, maybe it's a sawtooth wave: going down by 18 each time, resetting when hitting a lower bound? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the system is not purely subtracting 18 but there are other operations involved?

But without more context, it's hard to say. But given that in the initial part of the list, they're decreasing by 18 each time: 1854,1836,1818,... so I can assume an arithmetic progression with d=-18.

So if we proceed with that assumption, then beyond term104=0, the next terms are -18,-36,... and so on. So the given list from user shows at some point: ..., -32, -46, -60,...

Wait, let's compute what would be the actual AP terms after 0:

Term1:1854

...

Term103:18 (1854-18*102=1854-1836=18)

Term104:0

Term105:-18

Term106:-36

Term107:-54

Term108:-72

Term109:-90

Term110:-108

Wait, but the given list shows at some point:

..., -32, -46, -60,...

But according to AP, term107=-54, term108=-72.

So -32 would not be part of this sequence unless it's a different system. So perhaps there is an error in the problem statement or the user made a typo?

Alternatively, maybe the starting number isn't 1854 but something else? Let me check.

Wait, if I have to reach -32 by subtracting 18s from some higher number, how many steps would it take?

Let me compute:

Suppose term k = -32

If arithmetic sequence with d=-18,

termk = a + (k-1)*d =1854 + (k-1)*(-18)=-32

So 1854 -18*(k-1)= -32

Thus, 18*(k-1)=1854+32=1886

Then k-1=1886/18≈104.777...

Not integer. So no term is exactly -32 in this AP.

Similarly for term=-46:

1854 -18*(k-1)=-46

So 18*(k-1)=1854 +46=1900

Thus, (k-1)=1900/18≈105.555...

Not integer. So those terms don't belong to the original AP.

Therefore, either the problem statement is wrong or there's a different rule.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not an arithmetic progression but some other pattern?

Wait, looking at the given list near zero:

..., -32, -46, -60,..., -102, -88, -74, -60, -46, -32, -18,0

So before reaching 0, the terms go: ..., -32, -46, -60,...

And then after some point, they start increasing towards zero: -102, -88, -74,...,0.

This suggests that maybe it's not a single arithmetic progression but perhaps two separate ones or a different kind of system where values decrease until a certain point and then increase back to zero.

Alternatively, this could represent a cyclic system where after reaching a minimum value (-102), the terms start increasing by 18 each step: -102 +18=-84; but wait, in the given list it's -88. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, let me see:

After -102, the next term is -88 (difference of +14)

Then to -74 (+14), then to -60, etc., so difference here is +14 each time.

But 14 isn't a multiple of 18 or anything obvious.

Alternatively, maybe that's a different progression with common difference +14?

Wait:

Starting from -102,

-102 +14= -88

-88+14=-74

-74+14=-60

-60+14=-46

-46+14=-32

-32+14=-18

-18+14= -4? But the next term is 0. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, that doesn't fit because from -18 adding 14 would be -4, but in the list it's going to 0. So maybe adjusted?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different step.

But seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe this system represents some oscillation or wave function? Maybe sinusoidal? But without more info, hard to say.

Alternatively, if we think of it as a modulus operation, wrapping around after reaching a certain negative number.

Wait, 1854 divided by 180 is about 10.3; but 1854 mod something?

Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the system counts down by 18 until it hits -102, then starts counting up by 14 each time? Hmm, that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are being decremented by 14 in absolute terms, but alternately adding and subtracting? Not sure.

Wait, let's see: From term before -32 to -32 is a difference of +14 (i.e., going from more negative to less). But in reality, if you're moving towards zero, the differences would be positive.

But regardless, without a clear pattern or additional context, it's difficult to discern the exact rule here.

Given that, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that this is an arithmetic progression with d=-18, despite the discrepancies in the terms near -32 and -46. Maybe those are typos or mistakes in the problem statement.

Therefore, assuming an AP starting at 1854 with common difference -18.

So to find T(n), which would be the nth term:

T(n) = a + (n-1)*d

= 1854 + (n-1)*(-18)

= 1854 -18*(n-1)

Alternatively, written as 1854 -18n +18 = 1872 -18n.

But depending on indexing, if n starts at 0 or 1. If the first term is n=1:

T(1)=1854

So T(n)=1854 -18*(n-1)

Similarly, to find n when T(n)=-32,

We can set up equation:

1854 -18*(n-1)= -32

1854 +32 =18*(n-1)

1886=18*(n-1)

Thus, (n-1)=1886/18≈104.777...

Which is not integer, as we saw before.

Therefore, there's no term exactly at -32 in this AP.

So perhaps the given list has a typo or maybe it's a different progression.

Alternatively, maybe 1854 isn't the starting point but another number? Wait, without more terms, hard to figure out.

Alternatively, maybe instead of an arithmetic progression, the system is something else, like subtracting increasing amounts each time?

But looking at the differences:

From -32 to -46: difference is -14

From -46 to -60: -14

So it's decreasing by 14 each time. Then from -60, next term is not given but in the list after ..., we have -102, which is a big jump.

Wait, if from -60 subtracting something to get to -102:

-60 - x = -102 => x=42.

Hmm, that's inconsistent with prior differences of 14. So maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the system alternates between two different common differences? Maybe?

But again, without more info, it's speculative.

Given all this confusion and inconsistency in the given terms, I think the problem might have a typo or mistake in the sequence provided.

Assuming that the intended system is an arithmetic progression with d=-18 starting at 1854, then even though -32 isn't part of that AP, but maybe focusing on that as the primary rule.

Therefore, perhaps the rest of the terms were meant to decrease by 18 each time, and those other numbers are incorrect or part of a different system.

Given that, I think it's safest to proceed under the assumption that this is an arithmetic progression with first term 1854 and common difference -18. Therefore, all terms can be generated as such.

Thus, in conclusion, despite the inconsistencies in some of the given terms near the lower end, the primary rule seems to be an AP with d=-18 starting from 1854.

Final Answer
The system is an arithmetic progression where each term decreases by 18. Thus, the general form of the \(n\)-th term is \(\boxed{1872 - 18n}\).
</think>

Given the sequence provided, we start by analyzing the terms and identifying the pattern. The initial terms suggest a decrease by 18 each time:

- The first term is 1854.
- Each subsequent term decreases by 18.

This indicates an arithmetic progression with the first term \(a = 1854\) and common difference \(d = -18\).

The general form of the \(n\)-th term in an arithmetic progression is given by:
\[ T(n) = a + (n-1)d \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ T(n) = 1854 + (n-1)(-18) \]
\[ T(n) = 1854 - 18(n-1) \]
\[ T(n) = 1872 - 18n \]

Thus, the general form of the \(n\)-th term is:
\[ \boxed{1872 - 18n} \]
