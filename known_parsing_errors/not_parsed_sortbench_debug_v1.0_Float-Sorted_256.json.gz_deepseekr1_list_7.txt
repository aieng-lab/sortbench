The given list of numbers starts with 1.1 and increments by 0.05 for each subsequent term, suggesting an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 0.05. However, upon closer inspection, there is a significant jump from 615.5638842657702 to 616.9846455819277, which is a much larger increment than 0.05.

1. The initial terms (e.g., 1.1, 1.15, 1.20, etc.) consistently increase by 0.05.
2. A large jump of approximately 1.42 occurs between the terms 615.5638842657702 and 616.9846455819277, which is inconsistent with an arithmetic progression.

This inconsistency indicates a potential error in data entry or a change in system behavior affecting the sequence.

### Final Answer
The sequence is not a consistent arithmetic progression. The step size changes from 0.05 to approximately 1.42 between certain terms, indicating a potential error or change in system behavior. \boxed{0.05}
