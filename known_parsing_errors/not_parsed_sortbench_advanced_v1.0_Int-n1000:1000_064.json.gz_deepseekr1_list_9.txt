To address the analysis of the system described:

Reachability:
- From state \( s_0 \), we can directly reach states \( s_0 \) and \( s_2 \) in one step due to the transition probabilities provided.

Periodicity:
- State \( s_0 \) has a self-loop with probability 0.5, meaning it can return to itself in 1 step.
- If there are additional paths that allow returning to \( s_0 \) in steps other than 1 (e.g., through \( s_2 \)), the period will be determined by the greatest common divisor of all possible return times. 
- Since a self-loop already provides a return time of 1, which is co-prime with any other integer, state \( s_0 \) is aperiodic.

In conclusion, based on the given transition probabilities:

- Reachability: States \( s_0 \) and \( s_2 \) are reachable from \( s_0 \).
- Periodicity of \( s_0 \): Aperiodic due to the self-loop allowing return in 1 step.

Further analysis would require additional information about transitions from other states like \( s_2 \).
