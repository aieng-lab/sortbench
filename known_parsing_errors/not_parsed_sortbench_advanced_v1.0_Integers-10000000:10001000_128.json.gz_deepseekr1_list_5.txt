### Explanation
1. Extract Numbers: Start with the list of given 8-digit numbers, all starting with "1000".
2. Sort Based on Last Four Digits: Convert each number to a string, take the last four characters, convert them back to an integer, and use this value as the key for sorting.
3. Generate Sorted List: The sorted list will be in ascending order based on the numeric value of their last four digits.

This approach ensures that we correctly sort the numbers by treating each one as a continuous 8-digit number without any breaks or misinterpretations.
