### Explanation
- Dictionary Initialization: The dictionary `word_to_num` maps each number word to its corresponding integer value.
- String Splitting: The input string is split into individual words using the `split()` method.
- Word Processing: Each word is checked for hyphens. If present, it is split into subwords which are then converted to their respective numbers and summed. Non-hyphenated words are directly converted using the dictionary lookup.
- Error Handling: The function returns `None` if any part of a word is not found in the dictionary, ensuring robust handling of unknown inputs.

This approach efficiently converts each part of the input string into its numerical equivalent, providing a clear and structured solution to the problem.
