The code has a series of numbers that are being compared to determine if they are greater than or equal to the current maximum value, and if so, the maximum is updated.

However, there seems to be an issue with the logic in this code. The variable "max" is being used as both the index for the array "a" and the variable to store the maximum value found so far. This can cause problems because when you do `a[max]`, it's not actually checking if the number at that index is greater than or equal to the current max, but rather it's trying to get the number at the index which is the current max.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
max = float('-inf')  # initialize max as negative infinity

for i in range(0, len(a), 2):  # only consider every other number starting from index 0
    if a[i] >= max:  # check if current number is greater than or equal to max
        max = a[i]  # update max if necessary
print(max)
```

This code correctly finds the maximum value in the array "a" considering only every other number starting from index 0.
