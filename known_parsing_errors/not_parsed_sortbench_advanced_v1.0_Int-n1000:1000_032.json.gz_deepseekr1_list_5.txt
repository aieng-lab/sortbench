To determine how many negative integers from a given list have absolute values between 4000 and 8000 (inclusive), follow these steps:

1. List of Numbers: Assume you have a specific list of negative integers provided.

2. Calculate Absolute Values: For each number in the list, compute its absolute value. This changes each negative number to its positive counterpart without altering the magnitude.

3. Set Up Conditions:
   - The absolute value should be greater than or equal to 4000.
   - The absolute value should be less than or equal to 8000.

4. Evaluate Each Number: Check each number's absolute value against these conditions. If it satisfies both, count it.

5. Count the Qualifying Numbers: Keep a tally of how many numbers meet the criteria.

Example:

Suppose your list is: -9216, -8589, -8260, -7611, -7602, -7520, -6970, -6855, -6198, -5823, -5773, -5576, -5388, -4994, -4341, -3914, -3687, -3616, -3557, -3313, -3137, -3052, -2340, -2033, -1972, -1020.

- Calculate absolute values: 9216, 8589, 8260, etc.
- Check each against >=4000 and <=8000:
  - Numbers like 9216 exceed 8000, so they don't qualify.
  - Numbers between 4000 and 8000 (e.g., 7602) qualify.
  
Count: Tally all such numbers that fall within the range.

This method ensures you accurately count how many negative integers have absolute values in the specified range.
