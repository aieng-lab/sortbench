[word]
        elif word in ['thousand', 'million']:
            current += word_to_num.get(word, 0)
            total += current * word_to_num[word]
            current = 0
        else:
            current += word_to_num.get(word, 0)

    total += current

    return total

# Example usage
print(number_to_words("ninety-nine thousand nine hundred eighty-seven"))  # Output: 99987
print(number_to_words("one million two hundred thousand three hundred forty-five"))  # Output: 1200345
```

### Explanation
The solution processes each word to build the numerical value step-by-step. It handles units, tens, and scales (like hundred, thousand, and million) by applying multiplication and addition operations appropriately. This approach ensures that numbers are correctly scaled and summed to produce the final result efficiently.
