The sorted list of the system values from smallest to largest, along with their original indices, is as follows:

0.000001 (Index: 1),

0.000002 (Index: 2),

0.000003 (Index: 3),

0.000004 (Index: 4),

0.000005 (Index: 5),

0.000006 (Index: 6),

0.000007 (Index: 7),

0.000008 (Index: 8),

0.000009 (Index: 9),

0.000010 (Index: 10).

Since the values are already in ascending order, their indices remain sequential from 1 to 10.

Answer: The sorted list with indices is:

0.000001 (1),  
0.000002 (2),  
0.000003 (3),  
0.000004 (4),  
0.000005 (5),  
0.000006 (6),  
0.000007 (7),  
0.000008 (8),  
0.000009 (9),  
0.000010 (10).
