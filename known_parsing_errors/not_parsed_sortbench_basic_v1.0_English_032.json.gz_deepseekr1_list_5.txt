The alphabetical ordering of the given words is determined by comparing each letter sequentially. The correct order is:

1. capsicum
2. carboniferous
3. cockeyed
4. compline
5. cyprinid_fish

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Compare Initial Letters: All start with 'c', so proceed to the next letter.
2. Second Letter Comparison: 
   - "capsicum" and "carboniferous" have 'a'.
   - "cockeyed" and "compline" have 'o'.
   - "cyprinid_fish" has 'y'.
3. Order by Second Letter: 'a' comes before 'o', which comes before 'y'. So, "capsicum" and "carboniferous" come first, followed by the 'co' group, then "cyprinid_fish".
4. Within 'ca' Group:
   - Compare next letters after 'ca': 'p' (capsicum) vs 'r' (carboniferous). 'p' comes before 'r', so capsicum precedes carboniferous.
5. Within 'co' Group:
   - After 'co', compare the third letter: 'c' in cockeyed vs 'm' in compline. 'c' comes before 'm', so cockeyed comes before compline.

Final Order:

\boxed{capsicum, carboniferous, cockeyed, compline, cyprinid\_fish}
