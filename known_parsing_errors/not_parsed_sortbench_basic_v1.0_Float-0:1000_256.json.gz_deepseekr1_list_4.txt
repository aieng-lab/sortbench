It seems like you've provided a list of numerical values, but there isn't a specific question or context provided. Could you clarify what kind of analysis or assistance you're looking for with this data? For example:

- Are you looking for statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)?
- Do you want to visualize the data?
- Is there a particular pattern or trend you'd like to identify?
- Or is there another type of analysis you have in mind?
