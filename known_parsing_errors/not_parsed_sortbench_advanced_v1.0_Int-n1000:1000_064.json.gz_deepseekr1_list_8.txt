The next number in the sequence is 29. In such sequences, unless specified otherwise, negative numbers are typically not considered when all given terms are positive and increasing. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Identify the Pattern:  
   Look at the differences between consecutive terms:
   - 2 - 1 = +1
   - 4 - 2 = +2
   - 7 - 4 = +3
   - 11 - 7 = +4
   - 16 - 11 = +5
   - 22 - 16 = +6

2. Determine the Next Difference:  
   The differences increase by 1 each time, so the next difference is +7.

3. Calculate the Next Term:  
   Add this difference to the last term: 22 + 7 = 29.

4. Consider Negative Numbers:  
   Since all given terms are positive and increasing, negatives aren't involved here.

Answer:  
The next number in the sequence is 29, and negative numbers are not considered in this case.
