        hundreds_word = tokens[idx - 1]
        hundreds = word_to_num(hundreds_word) * 100
        remaining_tokens = [t for t in tokens[idx+1:] if t != 'and']
    else:
        hundreds = 0
        remaining_tokens = tokens.copy()

```

### Explanation

- Tokenization: The input string is split into individual words, which are then processed sequentially.
- Hundreds Detection: If the word "hundred" is found, the preceding word is converted to its numerical value and multiplied by 100.
- Remaining Tokens Processing: Any tokens after "hundred" (excluding "and") are summed up to compute the tens and units part of the number.
- Combining Results: The hundreds value is added to the tens and units value to produce the final integer result.

This approach efficiently handles numbers in the English language by breaking them down into manageable parts, ensuring accurate conversion from words to their corresponding numerical values.
