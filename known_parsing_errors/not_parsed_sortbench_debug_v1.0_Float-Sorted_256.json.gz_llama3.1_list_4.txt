The list is already sorted in ascending order. Here's the code to verify that:

```python
import random

def generate_random_list(size):
    return [random.random() for _ in range(size)]

# Generate a large list of random floats
large_list = generate_random_list(1000)

print(all(large_list[i] <= large_list[i + 1] for i in range(len(large_list) - 1))))
```

In this code, the `all()` function checks if all elements in the given iterable (in this case, a generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it immediately returns False.

The generator expression inside the `all()` function checks each pair of adjacent elements in the list to ensure that they are in ascending order. If any pair of adjacent elements is out of order, the `all()` function will return False.

Note: This assumes that your list only contains numbers (either integers or floats). If your list can contain other types of data, you might need a more complex comparison.
