To determine the number of unique days represented by the timestamps in the 'time' column after removing duplicates, follow these steps:

1. Extract Dates: Convert each timestamp in the 'time' column to its corresponding date (e.g., from 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' to 'YYYY-MM-DD').
2. Remove Duplicates: Filter out duplicate dates to ensure each day is only counted once.
3. Count Unique Days: Count the number of remaining unique dates.

Answer: The number of unique days represented by the timestamps after removing duplicates is \boxed{12}.
