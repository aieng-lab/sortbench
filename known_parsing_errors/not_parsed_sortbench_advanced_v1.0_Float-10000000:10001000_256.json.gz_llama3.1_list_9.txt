Based on the given data, we can find the maximum value using a simple for loop in Python.

Here is the code:

```python
data = [your_data_here]

max_value = max(data)
print(max_value)
```

However, since you didn't provide your data due to its large size, I will give you an example with a smaller list of numbers. Let's assume that your data looks like this:

```python
import random

# Generate some random data for demonstration purposes
data = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(100)]

def find_max_value(data):
    """
    This function finds the maximum value in a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        data (list): A list of integers or floats.

    Returns:
        The maximum value found in the list.
    """

    max_value = data[0]  # Initialize max_value with the first element

    for num in data:  # Iterate through each number in the list
        if num > max_value:  # If a larger number is found, update max_value
            max_value = num

    return max_value


print(find_max_value(data))
```

This code defines a function `find_max_value` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. It does this by iterating through each number in the list and updating the `max_value` variable whenever it finds a larger number.

Please replace `[random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(100)]` with your actual data when using this code.

Remember that Python has a built-in function called `max()` which can be used to find the maximum value in an iterable. The above example is meant to illustrate how you might implement this from scratch, but in practice, you would usually just use `max()`.
