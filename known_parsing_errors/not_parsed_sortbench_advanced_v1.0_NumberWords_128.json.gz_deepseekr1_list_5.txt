### Explanation
1. Reading Input: The input integer is read from standard input.
2. Dictionaries for Roman Symbols: Three dictionaries (`ones`, `tens`, `hundreds`) are defined to map each digit (0-9) in their respective places to the corresponding Roman symbols.
3. Handling Zero Case: If the input number is zero, the function returns "N" as specified.
4. Splitting the Number: The number is split into thousands and the lower part (hundreds, tens, units).
5. Converting Each Part: Each part (thousands, hundreds, tens, units) is converted to Roman symbols using dictionary look-ups.
6. Combining Parts: The Roman numeral parts are concatenated to form the final result, which is then printed.

This approach ensures that each part of the number is processed individually and efficiently combined to produce the correct Roman numeral representation.
