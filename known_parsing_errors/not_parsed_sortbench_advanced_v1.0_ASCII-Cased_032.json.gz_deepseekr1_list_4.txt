[input().strip() for _ in range(20)]

# Sort the list lexicographically using default string comparison
strings.sort()

# Print each string on a separate line
for s in strings:
    print(s)
```

### Explanation
1. Reading Input: The code reads 20 lines from standard input, each containing one string.
2. Sorting: The `sort()` method sorts the list of strings in place using Python's default lexicographical order. This means uppercase letters (A-Z) are sorted first, followed by lowercase letters (a-z).
3. Output: Each string is printed on a new line, resulting in the desired lexicographically sorted order.

This solution efficiently handles the sorting by leveraging Python's built-in capabilities, ensuring correctness and simplicity.
