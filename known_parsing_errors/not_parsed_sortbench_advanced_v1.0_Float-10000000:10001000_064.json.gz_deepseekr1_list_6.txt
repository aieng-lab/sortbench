### Explanation
- Reading as Strings: By keeping each number as a string, we avoid issues related to floating-point precision that can occur when converting between strings and floats.
- Custom Key for Sorting: The `sorted` function uses a lambda function that converts each string to a float for comparison. This ensures numerical sorting without altering the original string representation.
- Joining Strings: After sorting, the strings are joined into the required format using commas and enclosing them in square brackets.

This method efficiently sorts the numbers while preserving their exact decimal representations, ensuring both accuracy and correctness in the output.
