Alright, so the task is to produce a sorted list based on Python’s default lexicographical order, which is the normal alphabetical order for strings. The text specifies that the list contains words, so I'll use Python’s sorted() function to sort them in alphabetical order. Though some items in the list are spelled-out numbers like "three hundred and twenty-four," we’ll sort them as strings, not by their numeric value. My output will be the sorted list in the same format as provided.

The task is to produce a sorted list using Python's sorted() function, which sorts strings lexicographically based on Unicode code points. This means letters are ordered alphabetically. The list contains words like "three," "nine," and "thirteen" that start with letters like "t," "n," and "e." I can't run code, but I can reason through the sorting process step-by-step. I'll rely on my internal knowledge to simulate the sorting order and produce the final output in the required format.

Alright, I'll sort the list lexicographically, but since I can't execute code, I'll simulate the sorting process manually. It's easier to start by sorting based on the first character letter of each word, e.g., "e" comes before "f", "f" before "n", and so on. So I'll group words by their first letter, like putting all the "eight" words first, followed by "fifteen," "four," "five," etc. Each group will be sorted alphabetically, ensuring the list is ordered correctly. Now I'll produce the final sorted list output.

Okay, I’m reviewing the list, trying to ensure there are no duplicates. I see that "eight hundred and eighty-four," "eight hundred and eighty-six," and others are present. Important to note: "eight hundred and eighty" is indeed in the list already, so no need to repeat it. I also checked for "eight hundred and twenty-seven" and confirmed it's present. Now, I’ll make sure I only include unique words in the sorted list to avoid errors when I output it.

Okay, I've gone through the numbers in the list, now I just need to think about sorting based on the first character. Let's focus on the most basic step — first, I'll group words by their initial letter. For example, words starting with "e" (like "eight") come before those starting with "f" (like "fifteen"). Then, I'll continue sorting by the next character in the word and so forth, ensuring everything falls into the correct lexicographical order. I'll make sure the list follows this pattern carefully.

I’m sorting words starting with “eight” and comparing by their lexicographical order. First, I’ll sort items like "eight hundred and eighty" and "eight hundred and ninety-one" based on letters following "eight," like "ninety-one," "eighty-four," and "seven." I need to account for words like "eighty-two" versus those starting with "eight hundred," as spaces come before letters lexicographically. I'll sort each subgroup individually and ensure everything—including cases like "ninety-five" and "sixty-nine"—is in correct order.

I’m organizing terms starting with "eight", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "ninety", and "thirty." First, the "eight" group, like "eight hundred and eighty," comes before "eighty-two" due to the space. Then sorting subgroups based on their suffixes—like “eighty-four,” “eighty-six,” etc., I put them in order of their letters. For "fifty," "ninety," "seventy," and "sixty" groups, I follow alphabetical comparisons based on suffixes like "four," "nine," "six," and so on. This helps ensure correct sequencing.
