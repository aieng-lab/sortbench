Okay, I need to sort a list of floating-point numbers in ascending order. Python's built-in sorted function will do that easily since it sorts numbers in increasing order by default. I’m wondering about the duplicates—they will just stay in their respective places.

I’m thinking of running Python code in my head, but well, it's easier if I simulate it manually. Let me try identifying the smallest numbers first: "20.991323605502267", "24.0505314538243", and "25.85327845494301." I'll keep going with this.

To order the numbers, I start with the smallest: "20.991323605502267", then "24.0505314538243", and so on. As I go, I notice duplicates, which gives me a list where each number appears twice in ascending order. Let me list these from smallest to largest, as I count:



20.991323605502267 (x2)




24.0505314538243 (x2)




25.85327845494301 (x2)




35.72330671083668 (x2)




40.90694120160443 (x2)
... (continues in ascending order)
