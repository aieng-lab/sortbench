Okay, so the input list seems already sorted in ascending order with values like 7.034, 9.124, and 13.145. So technically, the output should be the same as the input. But wait, there are instructions to sort according to Python's default float sorting, which is ascending and stable. Since the list is already sorted, my output will be exactly the same. However, I'll need to make sure the formatting is consistent, with spaces and commas preserved, as specified in the instructions.
