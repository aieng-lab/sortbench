Okay, the task is to sort a list of floating-point numbers. The user gave the numbers in scientific notation, so we need to output them in the same format with the numbers sorted in ascending order. I don't need to sort manually, just sort logically using Python’s built-in sorting. The format of the list should stay as is, with values in scientific notation, and I’ll make sure the output strictly obeys the original format.

Since I’m sorting algorithmically, I’m visualizing it in my head. Let me try to lay out the numbers: 3.546e-08, 2.969e-07, 8.361e-07, 2.049e-06, 2.470e-06, 2.638e-06. These are all in ascending order at first glance.

But I’m realizing the sorting is tricky manually — I need to rely on Python’s sorting function to do this rather than attempt it in my head. I really can't reliably sort them manually.
