Okay, I need to help with sorting a list in Python. This is pretty straightforward since we're working with strings. The task is just to sort the list lexicographically using Python's built-in sorting method. Since the strings are all lowercase with underscores and hyphens, I just need to remember that Python would sort them according to ASCII values. So I’ll use sorted() and ensure I output only the list in sorted order, no extra explanation.

I need to sort this massive list in alphabetical order, so I’ll use Python’s built-in sorted() function. That will allow me to sort the strings lexicographically (based on the ASCII values). The list is a mix of strings with underscores and hyphens, but Python will handle these correctly in the sorting process. I’ll make sure to return the list in the exact format the task asks for—just the sorted list, no extra details! Let’s sort out that list!
