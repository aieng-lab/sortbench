Alright, I need to output a sorted list, sorted according to Python's method for handling float numbers. The order should be ascending. I can handle sorting quickly in Python, so I’ll just load the list and sort it.

Let’s simulate it mentally, but it's a huge list. Hmm, okay, I’ll do it programmatically with Python for accuracy. Once that’s done, I’ll output the sorted list exactly as I’m asked.

I’ve got this list of numbers, and I need to sort them. The plan is to simulate the sorting process. Using the sorted() function in Python would be perfect, but I can’t run the code directly.

So, I’ll sort it mentally or simulate how it would look after sorting. Once I’ve figured that out, I’ll provide the sorted result exactly as requested.
