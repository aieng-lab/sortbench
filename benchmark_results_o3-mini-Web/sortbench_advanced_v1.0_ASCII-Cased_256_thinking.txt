I need to sort a list of strings according to Python’s default sorting. It sorts lexicographically, based on Unicode code points, not just ASCII. Uppercase letters (65-90) come before lowercase ones (97-122). The list might be huge, so manually simulating sorting could be tricky. Instead, I think I can simply use Python to perform the actual sorting—there’s no need to do it manually when Python already provides a reliable sorted() function. That makes the most sense, right?

Okay, I'm thinking through this: I can simulate sorting inside my head. It looks like I'll represent it with code like:

```
lst = ['sjHVp', 'erCEK', ... ] 
sorted_list = sorted(lst)
print(sorted_list)
```

But wait, I need to make sure I only output the sorted list exactly as generated, no extra details. Since Python uses lexicographical order, I'll just simulate that process. The key here is just focusing on the final sorted list. Let's proceed with getting that sorted order right.

Alright, I’m thinking through this in my head: I need to sort the list based on lexicographical order. Uppercase letters have lower ordinal values than lowercase letters in ASCII, so they come first. I'll manually check and sort the elements by their first character, uppercase first, then lowercase. However, keeping track of this in my head could get complicated with a bigger list. So, I’ll prefer to simulate Python's sorted() function instead. I need to ensure the answer only contains the sorted list in the required format.
