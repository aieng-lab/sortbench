Okay, the task involves sorting integers in ascending order (Python's default). I’m assuming the data includes both negative and positive integers. The tricky part is the size of the list, but I can manually simulate it or theoretically use Python code to sort it. Since the output should only include the sorted list and nothing else, I'll prioritize that and keep it simple. I’ll proceed by computing the sorted list now—no extra text!

Okay, so I need to sort this list in ascending order using my mental process. I’ll start by identifying the smallest number. That’s -9990. Next is -9963, then -9892, and so on. I'll go step by step, ensuring the numbers are in proper sequence. Since I'm manually simulating, I need to be extra careful not to miss anything. I’ll check and recheck my steps to avoid errors — this process will be a bit tedious, but I’ll get there! Finally, I’ll produce the sorted list correctly.
