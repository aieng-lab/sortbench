I need to sort a list using Python’s common sorting method. The task asks to sort the numbers in ascending numerical order.

The list has numbers with the prefix "10000...," so I’ll treat them as integers for this. I can manually simulate for a bit, noting that the smallest number is 10000006, then 10000011, and so on.

However, I'll let Python do the sorting internally to ensure accuracy. I'll produce a sorted list for the output.
